## 🚀 About Me 
I'm a passionate Data Engineer and DevOps/DevSecOps Engineer with a strong focus on building scalable, secure, and automated systems. I specialize in optimizing data pipelines, ensuring seamless cloud infrastructure, and implementing robust security practices across the CI/CD lifecycle. With experience in cloud platforms, containerization, and infrastructure-as-code, I'm committed to creating solutions that are not only efficient but also secure by design.

On my GitHub, you'll find a mix of my personal projects, open-source contributions, and solutions that blend data engineering with DevOps and security practices. I'm always open to collaboration and learning, so feel free to explore and reach out!
